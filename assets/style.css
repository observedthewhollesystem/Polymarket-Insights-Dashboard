/*
  This is where you could put custom CSS if you weren't using Tailwind via CDN
  in app.py's index_string. For this example, we'll primarily rely on Tailwind
  classes directly in the layout.py for styling.

  If anyone here wanted to add more complex global styles, or styles for components
  that are hard to target with Tailwind alone, you'd do it here.
  Dash automatically serves files from the 'assets' folder.

  Example:
  body {
      font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif; // Already handled by Tailwind CDN setup in app.py
      background-color: #111827; // Tailwind class bg-gray-900
  }

  .custom-card-header {
      background-color: #374151; // Tailwind class bg-gray-700
      color: #d1d5db; // Tailwind class text-gray-300
      padding: 1rem;
      font-weight: bold;
      border-bottom: 1px solid #4b5563; // Tailwind class border-gray-600
  }
*/

/* Adding a very basic style to show this file is active if needed */
.test-asset-style {
    color: limegreen !important; /* This is just for testing if the asset folder is working */
}
